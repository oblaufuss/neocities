      <h1>The Fashion of Classic Comics Harry Osborn</h1>
      <p>I’m no expert in menswear (all info + photo examples come from <a href="https://vintagedancer.com/">VintageDancer</a>) but the way Harry Osborn's clothes choices evolve throughout the silver age of Spider-Man fascinates me from both a meta and a characterization standpoint.</p>

  <h2 id="ditko">Ditko era (1965)</h2>
  <p>Harry first shows up in ASM #31. He has an outdated look even for the time: the bowtie, brown/grey color scheme, and wide high-waisted pants with a skinny belt are all kind of 1940s/50s things. Not to mention <a href="https://oliveroctavius.tumblr.com/post/682958400044285952/before-there-was-willem-dafoe">the similarly old-fashioned hair.</a></p>
  <img src="imgs/oo-ditko.png" alt="Two Ditko-era panels of Harry wearing a brown suit over a white shirt with the previously described accessories, beside images from 40s/50s fashion catalogues of the same outfits.">
  <p>It seems Ditko’s vision for Harry was an insufferable stuck-up dweeb, a Norman Junior. You know those eerie photos of politicians’ families where the kids are dressed as tiny equally conservative versions of their parents? Yeah.</p>
  <p>Of course, once Ditko jumps ship and characterization catches up, Harry's desire (and failure) to copy his dad are going to become pretty important. As will, to a lesser degree, his belief in imaginary "good old days".</p>

  <h2 id="flashback">Characterization catches up (1966)</h2>
  <p>John Romita arrives in ASM #39 and the next issue gives us a flashback to baby Harry, who in contrast to his dad looks like an easter egg.</p>
  <img src="imgs/oo-baby.png" alt="A series of flashback panels. Child Harry's sweaters and vests are colored in various ways: red and blue, pink and orange, pink and yellow.">
  <p>On a practical level, bright colors (1) draw attention to Harry as a new main character and (2) conveys the passage of time. But it also fits with this issue's reveal that he’s actually a naturally sweet kid, just trying too hard to impress a brutally insensitive role model.</p>
  <p>I like that Ditko's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bow_tie_wearers">bow tie</a> sticks around. It has old-fashioned, dweeby connotations (as probably originally intended) but it also has very appropriate oddball performer connotations.</p>
