	<p>My "accordion countup" on the accordion index is actually the amount of time I've had Monica. I bought her at a little consignment store down the street for $98.50, and, well, she's a hundred dollar accordion alright. (For reference, a good used accordion usually comes in somewhere around $400.) All the notes sound more or less correctly when you hit the key, and that's all I really need to learn an instrument. But she's a bit of a fixer-upper, so it's a good thing that I enjoy some fixin' uppin'.</p>
	<p>Something slightly unusual is that she has 12 rows but only 4 bass buttons (counterbass, bass, major, minor) per row. I don't miss those 7th or dim chords yet, but I suspect I soon will.</p>

	<p>I also have this simple Schylling toy accordion. It's a diatonic button accordion in the key of C, with only 2 bass buttons. It's more or less a hand-operated harmonica, and quite frankly, it sucks. The buttons get stuck and the bellows leak and stick like mad.<br>
	Still, I'm thinking about modding or rebuilding it somehow. I think it would be a fun project.</p>
