 	<p>Why do I play accordion? Because <a href="aaa.html">accordions are awesome</a>, of course. And several of my favorite musical artists do, too. But it was this video of the New England Accordion Museum that captured me fully.</p>

 	<p>I now own a book by him, too: <a href="http://newenglandaccordionconnectionandmuseumcompany.com/accordion-stories-from-the-heart/">Accordion Stories from the Heart</a>. I hope to visit the museum sometime to thank that man and to see some of his collection. (Also to see the <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/433022344647147540/490650445874855946/IMG_HC-accordian-Ramunni_2_1_CR8RTI58.jpg">Hohnerette</a> that he has in his collection, because boy howdy is that thing weird.)</p>

 	<p><b>Got/want a piano accordion and don't know where to start learning?</b> Here's the first 4 <b>Palmer-Hughes</b> books, designed to bring the beginner musician through the process of learning accordion from scratch. These are what I'm using! (<a href="Palmer-Hughes%20Accordion%20book%201.pdf">Book 1</a>) - (<a href="Palmer-Hughes%20Accordion%20book%202.pdf">Book 2</a>) - (<a href="Palmer-Hughes%20Accordion%20book%203.pdf">Book 3</a>) - (<a href="Palmer-Hughes%20Accordion%20book%204.pdf">Book 4</a>). And if those are too easy, then try for some fancy fingerwork. <a href="P-Hanon-for-the-Accordion.pdf">Here's a PDF of Hanon accordion exercises.</a></p>
