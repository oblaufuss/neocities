<p>This is <a href="myaccordions.html">MY ACCORDION,</a> safely buckled in for a nice car trip. She's a slightly unusual 48-bass I've affectionately nicknamed Monica. For more on her (and my forays into accordion repair), click the image above. (COMING SOON)</p>

 	<p>Why do I play accordion? Because <a href="aaa.html">accordions are awesome</a>, of course. And several of my favorite musical artists do, too. But it was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShowMeYourNerdGizmodo/videos/459227467849100/">this video of the New England Accordion Museum</a> that captured me fully. I hope to one day visit the museum in person to thank that man and to see some of his collection. (Also to see the <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/433022344647147540/490650445874855946/IMG_HC-accordian-Ramunni_2_1_CR8RTI58.jpg">Hohnerette</a> that he has, because gee whiz.)</p>
