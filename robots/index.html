	<h2>ROBOTS</h2>
	
	<p>I'm a freshman currently majoring in robotics, unless I decide to switch to computer science, and I feel a little bit out of my league. Lots of the other students were on robotics teams and participated in FIRST and watch Battlebots religiously. I was rejected from my high school team twice because the team was already too big to fit more people. But I think I'll be able to catch up if I try. Here's what I've done this year.</p>

	<p><b>SEPTEMBER 2018: Dozer's Revenge</b></p>

	<p>Built for a 48-hour combat robotics hackathon, this guy was modeled after unofficial FRC mascot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm9nd-3hW_E">Dozer</a>, with an added vertical spinner.</p>

	<p>Oh, and ANGRY EYEBROWS. Man, he's adorable. The wheel armoring had to be sheared off to fit weight requirements and get the wheels on in time, so we gave him silver "hubcaps", which were just <a href="dozer_busted_wheel.jpg"> spraypainted giant googly eyes</a>.</p>
