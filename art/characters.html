			<p><b>York <i>(code name: John Y)</i></b><br>
			Gadgeteer genius with an even worse flair for the dramatic. He has a knack for reverse-engineering and hotwiring anything he can get his hands on, and could probably MacGyver his way out of Alcatraz with a toaster, screwdriver, and roll of Scotch tape. He thinks best on his feet, which is a lucky thing: a tendency to not do the math until AFTER he's bolted everything together tends to blow up in his face, literally. With Xander looking over his shoulder to make sure he's "insulated the wires" and "turned it off before he plugs it in" and other small details, his success rate is much higher. Hey, a short sharp shock gives you that hair-on-end inventor look that all the ladies love.
			<br>His ambitious rise into the world of villainy has made "John" a minor celebrity of the "people screaming in alarm when you walk down the street" variety, but it's a small price to pay for a job as cool as his. He has BIG plans in store for Giantopolis.... as soon as he works out what they are.</p>

			<h3>Leo</h3>
			<p>
			A young boy with a big imagination. After his astrophysicist dad showed him the Cosmos TV series, he knew that one day he wanted to go to space. But no matter how many books he read or glow-in-the-dark stars he stuck to his ceiling, it all seemed so far away.</p>

			<h3>Kevin</h3>
			<p>A slightly bedraggled stuffed alien that Leo found and took home with him one day. Or is that just his cover story?</p>
			<p>Which is harder to believe? That an alien stranded on earth would disguise himself as a children's toy, speak to a little boy in a language only he could understand, and show him</p>
