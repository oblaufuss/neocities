    <h1>SORRY</h1>
    <p>The page you wan't doesn't exist. There's nothing here. Except for this. A lonely note left inside a black hole that reads "KILROY WAS HERE".</p>
    <p>But at least it's a moment of peace and quiet.</p>
    <p><a href="https://bluef00t.neocities.org/">Go Back Home.</a> Or stay here forever, it's all the same to the void.</p>
