	<p>I'll start out by admitting that I'm no nuclear expert. I'm a robotics undergrad; I just have a casual interest in nuclear power and related sciences. I might make some factual errors here without noticing, but I've tried to double-check and source any scientific claims I make. Anyways, in my opinion, good scifi isn't about "is this technically true", it's about "does this make sense?" If things in the movie's world are meant to be different from reality, that's okay, but how well are they explained?</p>
	<p>I'm not writing this to seriously educate you on fusion, or to tear apart a hammy movie for having hammy science. No, I am here to elevate that ham for you, so that when Alfred Molina opens his mouth at the climax and says the most derangedly scientifically backwards line in that masterfully-acted serious professor voice of his, you too can feel your soul leave your body in real time.</p>

	<p>I love this movie.</p>

    <h3>Just getting this one out of the way now.</h3>
	<p>Before we begin, let's lay down a weird little quirk of the Raimi Spider-man universe: nuclear radiation doesn't actually exist. That's right, you heard me. The spider that bit Peter was genetically modified in this version, not radioactive, remember?</p>
	<p>You can rewatch the trilogy if you want. Nobody ever says the word "radiation" or "radioactive", even around things that by all means should be (like the particle accelerator in 3 or the fusion reactor in this movie.) If they never mention it, we can ignore it too. Anything that would be dangerously radioactive in real life we can assume is harmless, and can be handled and viewed unshielded.</p>
	<p>Got it? Well, now that we've established that radiation doesn't exist, let's talk about the nuclear physics of Spider-Man 2.</p>

	<img id="tritium" src="https://scienceonblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/doc_with_tritium.jpg">

	<h3>Precious tritium is the fuel that makes this project go.</h3>
	<p>We're starting on the most scientifically solid end here. Tritium is a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium">real thing!</a> It is a very rare-in-nature, radioactive isotope of hydrogen, used to fuel <a href="https://www.iter.org/sci/FusionFuels">real-life fusion reactors.</a> The depiction isn't factual to a T (since tritium is a form of hydrogen, it's a gas, not a solid, and <a href="https://scienceonblog.wordpress.com/2016/10/27/tritium-in-spider-man-2/">there's more than  the quoted "25 pounds" of it</a> in the world. It's a fairly common byproduct of nuclear fission.)</p>
	<p>But accurate science does not good science fiction make. Both of these "inaccuracies" are clearly stated world rules, and actually good for story clarity. Overemphasizing the rarity of tritium makes coming back to Harry to ask for it make sense; Doc Ock can't get it another, less plot-advancing way. And giving it a distinct physical form makes it easy to follow what's happening onscreen and lets us recognize the same substance (and how much more of it there is!) the second time around.
	</p>

	<h3>Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your seatbelts.</h3>
	<p>Ignoring the total lack of shielding and safety measures on everything, we are somehow still on scientifically-recognizable ground as Dr. Octavius powers up the reactor. This is a cartoonified depiction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion">inertial confinement fusion (ICF).</a> The simplified visuals of the movie explains the idea pretty well: you point lasers at all sides of a fuel pellet to super-heat and compress it to the point where it becomes plasma and a fusion reaction occurs.</p>

	<p>I know I just got on the movie’s case for depicting tritium as a solid, but we can actually give them the benefit of the doubt here:  This reactor might be an indirect-drive method of ICF, and the shiny dodecahedron thing that they call tritium actually is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohlraum">"hohlraum"</a> (fuel containment vessel) for the tritium gas, which are usually made of uranium or gold. I didn't actually know that before I started writing this article. Imagine that, we just learned some nuclear physics that made Spiderman 2 <em>more</em> plausible.</p>

	<p>In real life, you’d have to keep these lasers on to keep the fusion reaction happening. Fusion really doesn’t want to happen; the fuel needs to be kept unimaginably hot and unimaginably compressed to stay plasma and keep reacting. An uncontained fusion reaction isn’t possible on Earth. Unlike nuclear fission, if any fuel escapes, it won’t keep producing energy—it will just poof back into hot gas. The biggest problem of fusion science is keeping the fuel from touching something not as hot as it. That’s one of the things that makes fusion so much safer than fission.</p>

	<p>But <em>safety</em> is much too boring for a comic book movie. We want to see something blow up. It's time to start breaking physics.</p>

	<img id="sun" src="https://scienceonblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/sun_tritium.jpg">

	<h3>The power of the sun...</h3>

	<p>The moment that the fusion reaction begins, the lasers turn off. But you probably didn’t register that physics broke there—I sure didn’t! At the same moment the movie makes a dumb science choice, it makes a brilliant storytelling choice: it depicts the baby fusion reaction as a sun.</p>

	<p>The sun is an example of a fusion reaction that a six year old can recognize. Everyone knows the rules of the sun. The sun is self-sustaining. It’s roughly spherical and holds its shape on its own. It has sunspots and solar flares. It has a magnetic field. The miniature fusion-sun even goes supernova at the end of the disastrous demonstration, and that still makes intuitive sense. Stars do that!</p>

	<p>It should be noted that none of those qualities of the sun that I just listed are qualities of nuclear fusion as done on earth—they’re all things that happen because the sun is absolutely enormous. The sun’s fusion reaction is “self-sustaining” only because the crushing weight of its own mass takes the place of a reactor’s constantly-firing lasers. Gravity doesn’t work like that scaled down, but I’m not going to CinemaSins-ding this yet.</p>

	<p>Superhero movies are packed with similes like this because they work well to get an audience on board with a complex or simply absurd concept fast. Spider-Man is like a spider. When he starts shooting webs from his hands, that’s consistent with our simile, and the audience accepts it. (<a href="https://donttellharry.com/2020/06/09/can-spider-man-shoot-his-own-webs/">Except for the angry fanboys who know he doesn't do that in the comics.</a>) If he started shooting lasers from his hands that would raise some eyebrows. We don’t have to know why anything works, as long as we know how it works, and that “how” stays consistent. </p>

	<p>And while I deduced all these things oh-so cleverly from the operation of the fusion reactor onscreen and my knowledge of star behavior, the movie has the courtesy to just tell you this straight out. “It’s like a perpetual sun providing renewable power,” Otto tells Peter. We’ve entered science fiction territory, but the rules are clear. So far.</p>

	<img id="frequencies" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/275371719055769601/891853424625324082/unknown.png">

	<h3>Sympathetic frequencies.</h3>
	<p>So Otto’s fusion reaction is, unlike in real life, self-sustaining under ambient conditions. Gosh, that sounds dangerous. How do you plan to keep it contained in that big reactor of yours, doctor?  Lucky for us we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNeFDNelxrQ">this scene</a> where Peter and Octavius discuss what the machine does.</p>
	<blockquote>
		"This is my design to initiate and sustain fusion."<br>
		"I understand you use harmonics and atomic frequencies."<br>
		"Sympathetic frequencies."<br>
		"Harmonic reinforcement?"<br>
		"Go on."<br>
		"An exponential increase... in energy output!"
	</blockquote>
	<p>This exchange is so funny. It's the most brazen technobabble I've ever heard, and I like Star Trek. You’re meant to think, “Gee whiz! I didn’t understand a word of that. They must be so much smarter than me.” However, I’ve seen the rest of this movie, and I know how ridiculous things get by the end, so I’m thinking: “Gee whiz! I didn’t understand a word of that. They’re just saying random sciencey words in thoughtful voices, aren’t they.” Most of those aren't even full sentences. You can barely respond to the science here because no actual claims are being made. Net zero information! Woo!</p>
	<p>Normally, if a story handwaves over part of the science, you can safely ignore it, but this is kind of extremely plot important. We want to be able to understand it at least enough to know when the characters are safe or in danger, or how risky a choice is.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>With all the times Otto refers to "my calculations", we get the idea that he might have just calculated how it would go ahead of time, and doesn't actually have a way to contain it, other than... the arms.</p>

	<h3>It's self-sustaining now.</h3>

	<p>This fusion reaction sucks in massive chunks of metal and just keeps getting bigger. This is completely backwards to the actual process of fusion. We are far into comic book scifi land now.</p>
	<p>Hang on. In real life, releasing containment or adding heavier elements are the two ways to make a fusion reaction go out. Now they've just demonstrated that both of those things actually make this fusion reaction larger. But our protagonists are supposed to be able to stop it. Have they written themselves into a corner? 
</p>
	<p>Of course not! Otto Octavius has an idea to save the day!</p>
