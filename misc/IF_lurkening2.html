	<p>So where did we leave off? We've explored G.U.E. tech pretty well within the 9-turn-limit imposed on us.
<br>We've been through the tunnel system and met the hacker and Ynf-Okh-Omm, the Eldest Horror. We've been through the under-tunnels and seen its dark roots drinking from the power supply, and also seen some slime. We've been to the Necromancy building, the Linguistics building, and the despicable Sorcery building with the rude grad student.
	</p>
	<p>I think we should pay him a call again now that we have some dark sorcery up our sleeve.</p>

<b>The Lurking Horror II: The Lurkening</b><br>
An MIT Mystery Hunt Puzzle by Ryan Veeder, with apologies to Dave Lebling<br>
Release 2 / Serial number 180118 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N)
 <p>
<b>Alchemy Basement</b><br>
Your vision clears, and you're back in the basement of the Alchemy building.
 <p>
This is one of your favorite haunts on the G.U.E. campus. It's a great place to curl up with a book—but you really don't have time for that right now.
 <p>
There's a stairway here that leads up to the Department of Alchemy lobby, and a well-lit tunnel leads north.
 <p>
You'd better start moving if you're going to get anything done this time.</div>

<p>Yes, this basement which we know so well. We remember the way to the Sorcery building:</i></p>

<div class="game">
	<i>>go up</i><br>
	<b>Department of Alchemy Lobby</b><br>
	The Alchemy building feels small and defenseless in the face of the wild thunderstorm outside. Rain and howling wind pound at the doors to the north and east. A stairway leads down to the basement (and the tunnels).
	<p>
	This lobby is especially creepy because there's an informative poster depicting an Elder Horror hanging on the wall.
</div>

<p>Already read the poster and learned the incantation, thanks. RAENFIDHRE, banishes elder horrors, except for the one we want banished most, of course.</p>

<div class="game">
	<i>>go north</i><br>
	<b>Construction Site</b><br>
	Torrents of rain lash at the earth in blind fury.
	<p>
		This is the future site of the Gentry Antiquarian Center. Right now it's a rectangular pit with concrete walls.
	<p>
		The Alchemy building is south. Another building—a despicable building—is further north.
</div>

<p>
	Oh, wait a minute. We didn't engage with the rectangular pit before, did we? Not even to look in it. Shame on us, calling ourselves a text adventurer. You don't put a giant pit in the ground to not be looked/crawled into.
</p>

<div class="game">
	<i>>look in pit</i><br>
	The cyclopean walls of the unfinished Gentry Center are slick with rain, and its muddy basement floor is pockmarked with oily puddles.
 <p></p>
Floating in one puddle is a manila envelope.
</div>

<p>
	Bingo. <br>(Note: The use of "cyclopean" confused me, the first time I played this, because how could a wall be like a cyclops? But our dear friend Veeder is actually making fun of Lovecraft's overuse of this impressive-sounding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclopean_masonry">classical Greek masonry term</a>.)
</p>

<div class="game">
	<i>>take envelope</i><br>
	There's no safe way to reach the envelope from up here.
	<p></p>
	<i>>get in pit</i><br>
	The slick concrete walls of the pit offer no safe way down.
</div>

<p>Now you're just mocking me. Any good spells? Cold, light, banishing, slime... not very pr- Hey, wait. Slime?</p>

<div class="game">
	<i>>JILXUBE</i><br>
	You struggle to pronounce the abhorrent incantation properly. When you finally get it right, a huge mass of slime appears out of nowhere.
 <p></p>
The slime, driven by an invisible and irresistible impulse, flows into the subterranean walls of the construction site, filling the pit until the level of the ghastly liquid is even with the surrounding earth. A manila envelope floats up to glide lazily over the surface.
 <p></p>
An idea creeps over your brain that the slime may have done all this because you wanted it to, and you shudder.
</div>

<p>
	I am the slime whisperer....
</p>

<div class="game">
	<i>>take envelope</i><br>
	Reaching the envelope now would require swimming through a pool of slime, which is a no-go.
</div>

<p>
	Yeah, maybe if you're a coward.
	<br>Fine. We can cater to the wusses in the audience here. Maybe we could blow the envelope over to us with our Cold Wind spell?
</p>
<div class="game">
	<i>>BHEISHAUPH</i><br>
	You breathe the incantation, and a breeze of cool air swirls around you.
 <p></p>
Crystalline patterns appear in the surface of the pool of slime, spreading across and down through the repugnant morass. The surface of the fluid ceases its undulations: It has frozen straight through.
 <p></p>
The manila envelope sits on top of the ice.
</div>

<p>Even better!</p>
