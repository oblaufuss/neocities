	<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> Sometimes I cite Jhonen Vasquez and the DVD commentary as evidence. Sometimes I outright contradict Jhonen Vasquez. This is because Jhonen is full of lies and will either say whatever the people want to hear most or whatever the people want to hear <em>least</em>, depending on his snark levels at the moment.

	<h3 id="Biology">Irken Biology</h3>
	<p>In many ways, the Irkens were designed to fit the classic "little green men" archetype: short, smooth green skin, large bug eyes and antennae. I like to regard these characteristics from an insectoid point of view rather than a pop-culture alien one. (Zim fanart that makes him look like an odd green human child bothers me: it's not that he can't be cute, but that he <a href="https://bogleech.tumblr.com/post/151506245388/titleknown-friendlytroll-rad-roach">shouldn't have to be human-cute.</a> He should be cute like a ladybug. He IS cute like a ladybug.) 
		<br>The Irkens' bright, bulging, chitinous eyes and their antennnae are wonderfully expressive. Irkens never seem to use their antennae for any sensory function, though they might've had that ability before the Irkens became a cyborg race (more on that later). Expressively, the antennae move much like cat ears, flat back in fear, straight up in surprise or excitement, cocked when curious. Irkens seem to have, but rarely use, conscious control over their position (like <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Wiggle-Your-Ears">learning to wiggle your ears</a>). Too bad. I love imagining Zim rubbing his antennae diabolically together.</p>
	<p>The biggest hole in the insectoid interpretation is that <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/zimwiki/images/3/34/1x01-The-Nightmare-Begins-invader-zim-23520797-500-282.jpg">Irkens have internal skeletons,</a> not exoskeletons. I'll give the animators the benefit of the doubt that this is to preserve the clarity of cartoon tropes like x-rays, electrocution, expressive teeth, and slapstick injury, not just a failure of imagination. Actually, regarding teeth, Irken teeth are NOT part of the skeleton. They appear <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/zimwiki/images/8/81/Tak_thng_4.jpg">rounded, pink, and fused together,</a> unlike the teeth of humans in the show. This implies weird fleshy-cartilaginous appendages (maybe something like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/48wudq/this_duck_with_saw_teeth_the_goosander/">waterfowl "teeth"??</a>), which is... a weird and unexplored design choice. I feel sorta cursed by that knowledge.</p>
	<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/zimwiki/images/8/84/Species_Irken_Organs01.png" style="width: 40%; max-width:350px; float:right; padding: 15px;">
	<p>The visceral humor of the Jhonenverse actually gives us a pretty good idea of <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/zimwiki/images/8/84/Species_Irken_Organs01.png">what's inside an Irken.</a> They definitely have a brain and a nervous system, and likely a heart, but are mostly digestive system ("<a href="https://zim.fandom.com/wiki/Irken_Biology#Organs_and_Anatomy">squeedlyspooch</a>"). This seems a little pointless, as all Irkens ever eat is junk food, the PAK converting this to useful energy anyways. Zim tends to scream "AAAUGH MY SQUEEDLYSPOOCH" when something whacks him anywhere, but that proves nothing- give any friend a good kick in their internal organs and they'll probably yell "OW, WHY, MY STOMACH" whether or not that was the specific organ injured. 
		<br>An organ Irkens DON'T have are lungs. Without the human weaknesses of wet, soft eyeballs or easily-ruptured interal air sacs, the Irken race takes a rather cavalier attitude towards the vacuum of space. Smaller spacecraft can open the windshield during flight while the pilot is inside, but larger Irken vessels have airlocks. The Tallest sometimes throw bad Irkens out the airlock, so they definitely do need to breathe eventually, but their PAK seems to give them a lot of leeway (breathing room, one might say).</p>
	<p>Nickelodeon really had a thing against <a href="https://zim.fandom.com/wiki/Bloody_GIR">showing blood</a> so it's never pictured in the series, but Jhonen has said that Irken blood is a clearish-pink, which is a ROCKIN' character design choice from a color theory standpoint. To mesh this with injuries shown in-show, Irken blood is probably dark green under the skin but turns pink on contact with air (like the common myth about <a href="https://sciencebasedlife.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/lack-of-oxygen-turns-blood-red-not-blue/">human blood being blue</a>). Dark green is a <a href="https://animalhow.com/animals-blue-green-white-yellow-blood-color/#Which_Animals_Have_GREEN_Blood">perfectly valid blood color</a> and is also really cool.</p>
	<p>The mysteries of Irken biochemistry are a little beyond me, and not just because the cartoon itself seems to forget what things Zim can or cannot eat or touch. <a href="https://zim.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wettening#Trivia">Jhonen's explanation</a> for Zim's inconsistent weakness to water is that chemical contaminants, not the water itself, are what hurts Zim. The Jhonenverse is so thoroughly disgusting that it's a wonder everyone doesn't get chemical burns.
		<br>Zim's reaction to earth meats seems more arbitrary, but mad as it is, I have a theory. Zim's bad reaction is characterized as an "allergy", but as someone with food allergies, I have never had something I'm allergic to FUSE to my SKIN. Irkens have remarkable healing abilities, facilitated by the PAK. It may be that some earth meats react badly (or far too well) with the Irken immune system, accepting and attempting to graft the foreign flesh onto the Irken's skin.
		<br>Now, I'm an engineer, not a biologist, but I'm pretty sure every part of what I just said is ridiculous and wrong. But it amuses me and makes superficial sense, so that's what I'm sticking with.<p>

	<p>Irkens <a href="http://www.questionsleep.com/">don't sleep</a>. Sounds nice.</p>

	<h3 id="Biology">My Neo-Pulp Recs</h3>
	<p>The following titles are modern pulp adventure series that meet my personal neo-pulp criteria of good taste:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Commit to the bit.</b> Get cheesy, get serious, get <em>weird.</em></li>
		<li><b>Extend, don't just imitate.</b> A little nostalgia provides fun flavoring; nothing <em>but</em> nostalgia is a mark of insecurity and lack of critical thinking. The spirit of what made pulp adventure fun can and should be applied to new places, times,  and ideas.</li>
		<li><b>Share the genre.</b> Characters who aren't white dudes should <em>exist,</em> among our protagonists, with their own opportunities to get in on the action and character progression.</li>
	</ol>
