		<p>On the day the world ends, the government sends everyone home to bed.<br>
"Nobody is essential," they say. "Not anymore. We want to go home, too. It's okay. It's all over."<br>
I have a bed to lie in while I wait and a warm body to wait next to me<br>
But I wonder, as I wait for the shoe to drop, what about those who didn't?<br>
Did the billionaires and landlords and everyone throw up their hands and let the homeless into the thousands of now-worthless beds?<br>
Will they give them now in death something that was only of use in life?<br>
If they threw open their doors it would be the biggest news story of the century<br>
But I can't check the news<br>
Because the newscasters are all at home in bed.<br>
It gets darker, and I wonder if it's the shadow of a cloud<br>
or something much larger rushing fast towards North America.<br>
And I wonder if it's better to imagine everyone will be in bed the day the world ends<br>
or to know that some people,<br>
some people,<br>
some people will not be.</p>
