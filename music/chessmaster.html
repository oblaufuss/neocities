 <p><b>>>>>> FAN #3: <a href="/me.html">Me!</a> <<<<<</b></p>
 <p>I first found out about the Chessmaster April 2018, <a href="http://tmbw.net/wiki/Mojo_Chessmaster">wrote the TMBW page on it</a>, and fell in love with it enough that I decided I needed my own. So I made one out of what I had: cardboard, spray paint, and a whole lotta hot glue. Obviously it's not functional, but I can't play guitar and I'm not a lefty, so who cares.</p>

 <p>I also really wanted a keychain (come on, TMBG merch store, get on this!) so when I had access to a laser cutter October 2018 I made my own.</p>

 <p>I made lots, so I sent some to friends. The mini Chessmasters now have homes in Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Iowa, and the Netherlands!</p>

 <p>Mike had the same idea as me, but first, and he's done the hard work to make SEVERAL functional replicas. Observe: the Mein Chessmaster!</p>

<p>He also built the body for this beautiful replica:</p>

<p>And COMING SOONish he's announced that he'll be making a blue and silver baritone Chessmaster!</p>
 <p style="font-size:10px">Fact: I heard this update right after getting off a very miserable and nauseous plane trip. The news made me so excited that I jumped to my feet--and then immediately barfed on the pavement. Not my proudest moment.</p>
