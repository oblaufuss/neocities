	<h2 class="redtext" id="introduction">an introduction to the show</h2>
	<p>Ah, Banana Man.</p>
	<p>Released in 2005; track 7 on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin%27s_Marvelous_Mechanical_Museum_(album)">Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum</a>. For many people, this was the first Tally Hall song they ever heard. I'm one of those people. I was in middle school in 2013 when a local high school a cappella group did a cover of it. (They called themselves The Testostertones, and in their talented hands the song became VERY much a dick joke.)</p>

	<p class="figure redtext">this is not my video; I am not to blame for the atrocious camera angle or sound quality</p>

	<p>However, the way <em>most</em> people encountered this song was via its music video, which became an early-internet viral smash hit when it was posted on  <a href="https://www.albinoblacksheep.com/video/bananaman">AlbinoBlackSheep</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050401011922/http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/">March 6th, 2005</a>. Since then, it's racked up over 7 million views <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yModCU1OVHY">on youtube alone</a>. The music is upbeat and catchy, but the video seems to have captured people's imaginations.</p>

	<p>Tally Hall’s breakout viral smash hit on <a href="https://www.albinoblacksheep.com/video/bananaman">AlbinoBlackSheep</a> in 2005. The song is upbeat and catchy, but it wouldn’t have gotten nearly as popular without the video. It’s goofy, it’s color-coded, and it’s cryptic. For many people, it was their entry point into the band.</p>
	<p>My introduction to Tally Hall was through Banana Man, though not the video. In 2013 I was in middle school, and one of the high school a cappella groups did a cover of it. The group was called the Testostertones, and in their talented hands the song became VERY much a dick joke.</p>


	<p>A decade later, Tally Hall still ranks among my top favorite bands, even as I’ve matured somewhat and my tastes have changed. (Fate of the Stars used to be an instant skip — <a href="greentie.html#FateOfTheStars">now it's one of my favorites</a>!)</p>
	<p>Banana Man as a song still holds that funky, banana-shaped place in my heart, I just didn’t think much about the video until recently. It feels like people have questioned this more in the past year or so. What does it mean? Does it have a secret hidden message? Does it mean nothing? Is there supposed to be symbolism hidden in the chaos? What's up with the face paint? Is the face paint <em>racist?</em></p>
