	<h2 class="redtext" id="introduction">an introduction to the show</h2>
	<p>Ah, Banana Man.</p>
	<p>Tally Hall’s breakout internet viral smash hit on <a href="https://www.albinoblacksheep.com/video/bananaman">AlbinoBlackSheep</a> in 2005. The song is upbeat and fun-sounding, but it wouldn’t have gotten nearly as popular without the video. It’s goofy, it’s color-coded, it’s cryptic! For many people, it was their entry point into the band.</p>
	<p>Banana Man was my entry to Tally Halldom too, but not through the video. In 2013 I was in middle school and I heard a high school a cappella group do a cover of it. It was sort of their theme song. The group was called the Testostertones, and in their talented hands it became VERY much a dick joke.</p>

	<p class="figure">this is not my video, so do not blame me for the atrocious camera angle or sound quality</p>

	<p>I was entranced. Eight years later (as of 2021), Tally Hall still ranks among my top favorite bands, even as I’ve matured somewhat and my tastes have changed. (I used to skip Fate of the Stars — <a href="greentie.html#FateOfTheStars">now it's one of my favorites</a>!)</p>
	<p>Banana Man as a song still holds that funky, banana-shaped place in my heart, I just didn’t think much about the video until recently. It feels like people have questioned this more in the past year or so. What does it mean? Does it have a secret hidden message? Does it mean nothing? Is there supposed to be symbolism hidden in the chaos? What's up with the face paint? Is the face paint <em>racist?</em></p>

	<p>I should give a backhanded thank-you to ElementFreak for inspiring this. He’s a smalltime youtuber with great music taste (and some <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/275371719055769601/844256324870340618/eftweet.jpg">godawful personal views</a>, but that’s unrelated to today's story). Here's the quote from one of his videos that got me thinking.</p>

	<p class="quote">“Is the Banana Man face paint racist?<br>I would say not.<br>
 	[...] It was orange, not black, and while the pattern accentuates his lips in a way very reminiscent of blackface, based off of the other face paintings done to the rest of the band in the exact same video, it seems to be more of an accentuation of emotional expression. Big smiles and big frowns, highlighted by a big ring around their painted mouths. It almost looks more like the greasepaint makeup on a clown.<br>
 	And since when were big, wild bugeyes part of blackface?”</p>

	<p>This threw me for a loop for several reasons. For one, I'd already opened the one single source on his video, which links to a section on the Wikipedia page on blackface, which starts with these words.</p>

	<img src="">
		<p class="figure">you're kidding me, right</p>

	<p>For another: <em>orange?</em> I actually went to ask if he was colorblind. <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/275371719055769601/844255996126035998/Screenshot_20210518-125056.png">He isn't</a>, he just mistook some fanart by DeviantArt user <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/rabidgolfcart/art/Banana-Man-529031694">rabidgolfcart</a> for something official. And then somehow didn't notice his mistake when editing his voiceover onto the actual music video, where it most definitely isn't that color.</p>
	<p>But it’s TOO easy to make fun of ElementFreak here. This is from a minute and a half segment of a 22 minute video on a mostly unrelated topic. He’s obviously no banana-man-scholar, he just wants to get to the next part of his video.</p>
