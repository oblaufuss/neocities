  <table></table>

  <p>I am (obviously?) a fan of this band, but I personally do not like Joe Hawley. I believe there are legitimate reasons to, and those reasons are worth mention.</p>

  <p>In recent years, Joe Hawley has been publically transphobic and allegedly verbally & sexually abusive in private. While some fans assert that these things have been "debunked", as of this writing (summer 2021) I've seen no convincing debunking evidence. These most serious accusations of sexual advances towards underage fans have been corroborated by some long-time followers of the band and acquaintances who I feel I can trust.</p>

  <p>I am also deeply disappointed by how other members (specifically Andrew, Ross, and the people at Needlejuice) have brushed off legitimate criticisms of this behavior, or even tried to keep them quiet. They've seemed unwilling to face the possibility that he makes fans unsafe, all while being publically friendly with Joe and profiting from the band's image.</p>

  <p>I made this page because I love the art this band has made and it's given me some very good times. But not everyone has the luxury of being able to separate the art from their personal experiences with the artist.</p>
