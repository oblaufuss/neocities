  <p>You don't actually need any fancy drawing skills to make the Tally Hall men recognizable. They've made sure of it. They are helpfully tagged, labeled, color-coded for your convencience. (Unless you're colorblind, in which case I'm so sorry.) But I happen to like the art of caricature, so I like going that extra mile. Here's some stuff I've noticed.</p>
  <p>Don't take any of this too seriously; there's no "one right way" to draw someone unless you're going for photorealism (which I am not). Most of this is based off the T.H.I.S./Marvin's era appearances since that's easiest to find references for.</p>

  <p>Rob Cantor, friendly everyman. Looks like the really nice kid in board game club who would try to get you into Magic: The Gathering, but when you can't understand the rules, agrees to play Settlers of Catan instead and you have an unexpected amount of fun. That isn't really a physical description but you get it, right?</p>

  <p>Cool specific features:</p>
  <UL>
    <LI>Face shape: pretty standard, but he has quite squishy cheeks (jowls?) like a toddler if your style is detailed enough to note that.</LI>
    <LI>Hair: helmetlike and shaggy, like a Beatle. Parts on the right (ours, not his).</LI>
    <LI>Eyebrows: perpetually raised as though in surprise; that's just how they're shaped.</LI>
    <LI>Eyes: surprisingly calm & half-lidded. Sometimes has wireframe glasses, which always seem to be slipping down his nose.</LI>
    <LI>Ears: like satellite dishes.</LI>
    <LI>Mouth: a little bit upturned, like :-< </LI>
    <LI>Trademark non-uniform outfits: the "total dweebus" (t shirt under a sweatervest)</LI>
    <LI>Other notes: Has a notable Orion's-belt of moles on one cheek. Also, extremely expressive and tends to pull ridiculous faces in which case all bets for recognizability are off. I can't believe a person's mouth can open that wide sometimes.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p>G&E era notes: grew the beard (literally) and got a better haircut. Started rolling up his sleeves more. The beard just accentuates the :-< mouth.</p>

  <p>Andrew Horowitz is a rather deadpan looking fellow. His default expression is strangely serious, and even when he smiles his facial features don't move much. He's unremarkable to describe but very distinct to look at. This could be a metaphor for the stuff he writes too, if you wanted it to be. But who needs metaphors.</p>

  <p>Cool specific features:</p>
  <UL>
    <LI>Face shape: a rounded-off guy, in general.</LI>
    <LI>Hair: Beatlesey but shorter this time. Parts on the left (ours, not his) and often has a little tuft escaping there.</LI>
    <LI>Eyebrows: low, dark, and parallel to his glasses frames.</LI>
    <LI>Eyes: never open very wide. Small, rectangular glasses that are always pushed all the way up.</LI>
    <LI>Nose: cool and distinct in a way that's hard to describe. Rounded at the end, and when he takes of his glasses, there's a distinct crease in the bridge of his nose where his glasses usually rest.</LI>
    <LI>Mouth: small and has a little point in it, like a bird's beak.</LI>
    <LI>Trademark non-uniform outfits: polo shirt, as immortalized in the lyrics of the WTTH demo.</LI>
    <LI>Other notes: looks smaller than he is because he has more kid-like proportions. This is hard to explain, so I'll just show this hopelessly blurry screenshot of him next to Ross, who is a small guy, but has definitely adult proportions:</LI>

  <p>G&E era notes: started wearing rounder glasses, also grew a faint beard and got kind of jacked. seriously I think he lifts now or something?</p>

  <p>"Zubin is Handsome."</p>
  <p>This should go without saying, but you'd be surprised: if you're doing something in color, note that he's obviously not white. Not that the other guys all have the same skintone, but if you care enough about recognizability to even be looking at this page, that's probably step one. With that out of the way...</p>

  <p>Cool specific features:</p>
  <UL>
    <LI>Face shape: oval similar to rob's, but despite being a skinny guy, he has a pretty clear double chin.</LI>
    <LI>Hair: I don't know the words for this but it's very wavy, and forms wispy curls near the ends in a way none of the other guys' do.</LI>
    <LI>Eyebrows: </LI>
    <LI>Eyes: very well-defined, dark upper and lower eyelids, one of his coolest features.</LI>
    <LI>Nose: mostly unremarkable but right up between his eyes, the bridge suddenly makes a shape like ) ( which I have never seen on another nose that I can think of.</LI>
    <LI>Mouth: very full lower lip.</LI>
    <LI>Ears: zubin sedghi does not have ears.</LI>
    <LI>Trademark non-uniform outfits: pastel v-neck t-shirts</LI>
    <LI>Other notes: a long and bendy sort of guy. have you seen his hands? them especially.</LI>

  <p>G&E era notes: also got a beard and a less shaggy haircut. But do not be fooled by the shorter haircut into thinking "oh, he has ears now". He <a href="https://relatable-pictures-of-zubin.tumblr.com/post/130471849241">does not</a>. He just <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JMmi4Ok5dCY/maxresdefault.jpg">doesn't have them</a>.</p>

  <p>this is, uh, (googles a <a href="https://www.allure.com/gallery/curl-hair-type-guide">hair curl chart</a>) type 3B/3C hair, I guess? Which is to say, afro lite. </p>
