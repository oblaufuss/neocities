	<h1>CD BOOTLEG PROJECT 2021</h1>
	<p>In an attempt to stop telling everyone I know about this project, I chronicle it here.</p>
	<table class="divider"></table>
	<br>
	<p>I've already done some bootlegs of the <a href="http://www.lemondemon.com/Lemon%20Demon%20-%20First%20four%20albums/">first four lemon demon albums</a>, which was fun. Still, I just found a site called <a href="https://kunaki.com/">Kunaki</a> that purports to be able to print very cheap CDs at a better quality than I can get on my home inkjet. Of course, it can't do tray cards or multipage booklets, so there's still plenty of fun for me to do by hand.</p>
	<p>UPDATE: <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/395044340138770434/842438111711854623/IMG_20210513_122404421.jpg">booklets have been printed, stapled, and cut</a>! Only half the disc/case art has been formatted though, so I'll wait to order them until they're all formatted.</p>
	<p>Here's the five albums I'm looking to make and the progress I have on each:</p>

			<a href="https://robcantormusic.bandcamp.com/album/not-a-trampoline"><h2 class="header-link">Not A Trampoline</h2></a>
			<p>By Rob Cantor. Fair game for bootlegging because it never got a physical release of any sort! Excited by the possibility of bonus tracks and a "contains 0% trampoline" hype sticker, or something of the sort.<br>
			Conveniently, I was able to find <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IM+Fell+Double+Pica?preview.text=Rob%20Cantor%20is%20%20NOT%20A%20TRAMPOLINE&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles">the font used</a> from the lyrics booklet PDF. It's come in handy and has allowed for some minor text-editing shenanigans.</p>
			<p>To format:</p>

				<LI>Front card interior [<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/667409942927376404/839885422679425075/coverback.png">✓</a>]</LI>

			</UL>
			<p>At this point, it's mocked up and ready to be sent to the printers once I get the other ones in order! Only printing the hype sticker will be left once it arrives.</p>

			<a href="https://okglass.bandcamp.com/album/american-legends"><h2 class="header-link">American Legends</h2></a>
			<p>By OK Glass. Fair game for bootlegging because it never got a physical release, and also the moment he found out I wanted to do a bootleg he sent me all the associated files plus extra font info. That was a great start! (And then he read this page and ALSO sent me the tray art. I am truly spoiled.)</p>
			<p>To format:</p>
			<UL>
				<LI>Front card [✓]</LI>
				<LI>Front card interior [ ]</LI>
				<LI>Back card [ ]</LI>
				<LI>Tray art [✓]</LI>
			</UL>
			<p>I've decided to forego disc art on this one, for, reasons. I'll just burn this disc at home. I hope I have some shiny blank CDs spare instead of the white write-on ones.</p>

		<div class="li1 li2">
			<img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0589618789_10.jpg">
			<a href="https://needlejuice.bandcamp.com/album/marvins-marvelous-mechanical-museum"><h2 class="header-link">Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum</h2></a>
			<p>By Tally Hall. My goal for this project is more of a Frankenstien than a bootleg proper. I'd already gotten my hands on (largely through the generosity of strangers and fellow fans!) some assorted orignal-pressing materials:</p>
			<UL>
				<LI>'05 MMMM lyrics booklet</LI>
				<LI>'08 MMMM CD</LI>
				<LI>High-quality scans of back card/tray cards</LI>
			</UL>
			<p>All I need to put this one together is the following:</p>
			<UL>
				<LI>Print back card/tray art [ ]</LI>
				<LI>Get clear-tray jewel case [ ]</LI>
			</UL>
			<p>This one will be a confusing little hybrid. Can't wait.</p>

			<img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0075794333_10.jpg">
			<a href="https://tmbg.bandcamp.com/album/long-tall-weekend"><h2 class="header-link">Long Tall Weekend</h2></a>
			<p>By They Might Be Giants. Fair game for bootlegging because it never got a physical release—in fact, when it came out in 1999, it made history by being the first digital-only album sold online!</p>
			<p>This already comes with a pre-formatted booklet and such, so it shouldn't be too much of a drag to work out. The disc art promises to be the most challenging part, it seems. Actually, the back card is kind of extremely ugly, and I might redesign it just because I can.</p>
