 <p>With such a unique visual appeal, it's no wonder this guitar has inspired a lot of cool projects and attempts at replication. </p>

<p style="text-align: center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/29655565" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The Chessmaster II (aka Mein Chessmaster aka Goldie) is a beautiful and incredibly accurate replica over 6 years in the planning and making, with all the original knobs and dials matched and a functional <a href="https://vimeo.com/58275740">VU meter (Volume Unit meter)</a> which he wired up. Mike restores and replicates <a href="http://rcatheremin.com/index.php">RCA Theremins</a>, so precision and manufacturing perfect parts are his specialty.</p>
<p>Mike gave Flansburgh a driver to power the original Chessmaster's (previously nonfunctional) VU meter in 2015, and in return was given a matching white pickguard for the Chessmaster II when the original Chessmaster got its pickguard in 2019.</p>
<p>He also built the body for this replica:</p>

<p>More recently, Mike Buffington also made a baritone Chessmaster, which he dubbed "the Opponent"!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xMeU9dznyBA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This guitar has slightly larger baritone proportions and an inverted color scheme: black pickguard, silver body, and a midnight blue back (to the dark mahogany-red back of the original).</p>

<h2 id="stickers">Holographic stickers</h2>
<p>These little stickers were designed by me in Adobe Illustrator, with some pointers from Mike on improving the proportions. They were printed through StickerApp, and I still have a limited number left <a href="https://gumroad.com/bluef00t#zQrZy">up on my Gumroad</a>. I intended to give these out at a TMBG concert, before a global disaster ruined all the fun. Still, I look forwards to sharing them sometime in a brighter future.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://bluef00t.neocities.org/music/imgs/chessmaster/stickers.jpg"></p>
<p>I am quite happy with how they turned out, and I might go for a third printing eventually. If so, I might make the pickguard solid white instead of bare holographic foil and remove the grey on the Gretsch pickup plate.</p>

<h2 id="lasercuts">Mini lasercuts</h2>
<p>When I first gained access to a laser cutter, I decided to try my hand at making little wooden Chessmaster cuts for keychains or pins (both of which are still something I would LOVE to see the TMBG merch store do). The VU meter seemed like a convenient placement for a hole through, and I ended up trying out several different sizes and materials.</p>

<p>I sent several to friends and even made a big batch that were covertly distributed by my good friend AJ on the 2019 JoCo Cruise.</p>
<p>In retrospect, there are a lot of subtle issues with the proportions on this design, but I'm still pretty proud of them.</p>

<h2 id="cardboard">Cardboard replicas</h2>
<p>Ah, cardboard. An accessible material for the amateur crafter who's into aesthetics over functionality. When I found out about the Chessmaster in early 2018, I fell in love and wanted a replica of my own. This was constructed from what I could scavenge from the high school art room: cardboard, spray paint, and a whole lot of hot glue. It's obviously nonfunctional, but I am not a lefty and can't play guitar, so that's irrelevant.</p>

<br>
<p>A year later, my now-pal <a href="https://galore.neocities.org/aboutme.html">Seymour</a> decided to make his own, at a scale which would fit the dolls in his collection. More information on how he made this one is <a href="https://galore.neocities.org/art/chessmaster.html">on his site.</a></p>

<h2 id="fabric">Textiles</h2>
<p>This little patch was handmade and sent to me by Kit Hornby in a fun TMBG stuff mail exchange. I love the little <b>:</b>â€¢D face that the knob placement makes. I'm going to try to get my sister to help me sew on a backing. I'm not sure where it will go afterwards; perhaps it will join my TMBG pin collection on my backpack.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../imgs/chessmaster/kit-embroidery.jpg"></p>
<p>Amber <a href="https://disinvited-guest.tumblr.com/">Disinvited-guest</a> crocheted this quilt square as part of a project to complete a TMBG-themed blanket. The finished product came out <a href="https://alas-my-crocheted-remains.tumblr.com/post/182173097640/finally-finished-my-they-might-be-giants-blanket">quite well</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cake">Cake</h2>
<p>This is a fun one. Let them eat cake!</p>
<p>This cake was made by Anneliese Canada in honor of John F's 60th birthday.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../imgs/chessmaster/anneliese-cake.jpg" style="max-height: none"></p>
<p></p>
<p>This second version was made in 2011 for (who else) Mike Buffington. The talented pastry chef in this case was Heather Marshall.</p>
