== Albums, Ranked By My Opinion On Their Album Cover Exclusively ==
span title=The worst part about making this There's no good image naming conventions on this wiki, so I had to look up each one myself. You have Why.JPG but Nanobots.PNG and then, god knows why, Glean_COVER.jpg. And why does Join_Us.png have an underscore, but not JohnHenry.png Why LongTallWeekend.png, but I_Like_Fun.jpg Anarchy. (I know it's probably because they've all been uploaded over a long stretch of time, but let me have my complaints.)With explanatory hovertext that explains nothing! spanbr
iNote these were done over a year ago now and I no longer have any recollection of why I ranked them this way, nor do I necessarily agree with how I ranked them. Proceed with caution.i

1110br 
span title=It reminds me of childhood visits to the Museum of Science. I made up the rating system, I can give it an 1110 if I want to. [[FileHere_Comes_Science.png180px]] span

1010 br
span title=5 words hot pink monster truck hearse.[[FileJoin_Us.png180px]]span
span title=I don't have justification for this one. It's just good.[[FileWhy.jpg180px]]span
span title=I used to think that the bit cut out of her face was octopus tentacles. Was mildly disappointed to realize it wasn't, but it's still dramatic and iconic. [[FileNanobots.png180px]]span
span title=If I didn't give this a 1010 the girl on the front would kill me.[[FileJohnHenry.png180px]]span

9.510 br
span title=Check out the wicked cool custom title font. Plus, getting hit by a car is a TMBG evergreen.[[FileMinkCar.png180px]]span
span title=Weirdminimalist in just the right way. Also I'm into NASA AND aquatic megafauna.[[FileApollo18.png180px]]span

span title=The PaRappa the Rapper artist did this cover. Pink is a good color for Them (as seen in Join Us and Why).[[FilePinkAlbum.png180px]]span
span title=Oversaturated, perhaps. Still, I enjoy the architectural quality. [[FileLincoln.png180px]]span
span title=Reminds me of the New England Gothic photography of Vicious516.[[FileThe_Else.jpg180px]]span

8.510 br
span title=It looks pretty good in person, in the CD jewel case.[[FileGlean_Cover.jpg180px]]span
span title=I love the texture. I made my own poster in the style of this cover after seeing it. [[FileI_Like_Fun.jpg180px]]span

span title=There's a version where he's pouring wine that I like a bit better.[[FileLongTallWeekend.png180px]]span
span title=Not sure how I like how it's cropped. The FLOOD logo is unshakably iconic, but it's ripped off from the IATSE logo so I can't give them too much credit for that.[[FileFlood.png180px]]span

7.510 br
span title=Nice retro-esque typography. Kinda disjointed otherwise.[[FileHere_Come_The_ABCs.png180px]]span

span title=Excellent typography as always, just very empty. A one-trick pony.

span title=I love the illustration, hate how it's obscured by the hard-to-read text.[[FileTheSpine.jpg180px]]span

span title=Objectively it might be fine, but I hate the color and I hate the creepy children. That's it. No.[[FileNo.png180px]]span
