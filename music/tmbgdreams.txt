I dreamed I went to a marvelous mechanical museum in a huge limestone cave, full of strange animals and unsafe attractions. The gift shop was selling stickers and inflatables shaped like the Mojo Chessmaster guitar, but someone had cut the upper horn off of all of them. I was infuriated.

I was hanging out with a kid I knew, talking about guitars, when he told me that Kurt Cobain had gotten a second Chessmaster guitar made in the 90s, and he had it back at his place. I couldn't beleive it and wanted to see it with my own eyes.

He pulled it out. It was wrapped in cardboard, but I could already tell from how weirdly it was shaped that it HAD to be the Chessmaster. I tore the packaging open.

Inside was just a normal banjo in a Chessmaster-shaped box. I was very disappointed.

I dreamed that I was watching a Danny Elfman interview where he said he'd known John Flansburgh in the 80s, and that he thought Flans was kind of weird. He claimed that Flansburgh had done a cabaret number dressed as/impersonating Elfman, which Elfman had taken as an offense rather than a compliment.

I dreamed I was at an "in-store" TMBG concert that was just, in the middle of a Walmart in Sweden. I left the concert briefly to talk to my dad, and when I returned, the audience was gone. In its place was a massive black security camera pointed at Them. TMBG was still playing.

Only tangentially TMBG--I dreamt was on a boat driven by two of my grandfathers, who kept arguing. A massive, bright purple storm was looming on the horizon, but they couldn't stop arguing long enough to commandeer the boat. What made me angriest was that they were endangering the young girl I was trying to protect, Mike Buffington's daughter.

At some point, I realized that I was pretty sure Mike doesn't HAVE a daughter. I Googled his name, still in-dream, and discovered that he was in his 40s and had created a bright red soda that he called "the Chessmaster." Sure enough, there was a picture of his daughter on the packaging.

Only after waking up did I remember Mike's rootbeer list. http://rootbeer.mikebuffington.net/

I dreamt I discovered fanart online of an AU where Linnell was an alien and Flansburgh was his "transporter" (whatever that means), but some sort of malfunction that JF was trying to fix was causing JL to manifest mantis-like features.

I dreamt Robin Goldwasser paid some hitmen pocket change to murder Flansburgh. Instead of killing him in any traditional fashion, they dragged him over to an escalator (significant, they said, because it was his "place of birth") and held him down over the spot where the stairs submerge until his clothes snagged and he got dragged into the internal mechanisms. It was very gory but very quiet.

This was followed by some jarring comic relief when Robin came back to the escalator (now as Rosamond Pike) and pried off a panel to reveal that all the blood was coming from a severed cow head, which opened its eyes and reacted like a happy dog to her presence, trying to lick her hand.

This dream left me with a short morbid fascination with escalators.

I dreamt that saying JF was dating a human-sized lizard was a new big meme, but then people decided that the joke had gone too far and started making posts like "remember that he's married, and furthermore, the only giant wrinkly lizard that he likes to hang out with is John Linnell."
This was really funny to me because of its sheer absurdity. It was actually made less funny by the time I woke up and remembered that "JL is a lizard" was actually a meme at one point.

I dreamt that John & John were posing to get their photo taken in front of the house that my brain identified as "the house from The Spine" (it wasn't, it had yellow siding) and the house had a big fence around it to keep the boar in. There was a huge boar in the yard, and they were trying to pose so that it would be in the photograph without angering it by mistake.

I dreamt I was going to college with John and John. JF had asked me out and I'd turned him down, but was worried he would take it hard. So I texted JL (who I often talked to, showed drawings to and such) to make sure he wasn't planning on doing anything rash. Linnell told me he'd gone to some place where they were making videos of setting monster trucks on fire. The rest of my dream was watching videos of monster trucks on fire.

I dreamt that someone I know was doing an interview with Dr. Seuss about the colors he envisioned for the illustrations that accompany his stories, and I was coloring them in as he described them to see how it would look. For some reason, all the illustrations from the first story were all stills from the Ana Ng music video. The others were James-Ensor-esque ink drawings of legions of skeletons marching or climbing or standing or otherwise doing things together.

I dreamt I found a Youtube video with a Nirvana and TMBG performance back to back. It was set sometime in the 90s, in a big sports arena.
Kurt looked rather tired. Krist kept going backstage looking for alcohol, then was told off for drinking the last of the milk. They played a song about stealing stickers off a car, which involved a big UFO prop with a guy that looked like the Foo Fighters bass player pretending he was driving the thing. The sound guys complained that Nirvana brought very strange sound equipment, including a tall deformed speaker that looked like an anthill.

When TMBG was up, John F was playing the Chessmaster (which looked rather wide compared to real life). They traveled around the whole running track as they played. I thought that it would have been better if they'd skateboarded around, but when I looked closer, they were running & sliding with their dress shoes the way you can do with socks on a polished floor.

I spent the entire dream thinking that my freind Felinium would love the video and was disappointed when I awoke to realize I couldn't send her a link.

I dreamt I was going to buy TMBG tickets for October 27th but couldn't remember if I was free that day, so I told the ticket seller "let me wake up so I can check my calendar", then woke up and felt extremely stupid.

I dreamt that I found a big tmbg forum dating back to the 80s (???) where I found my new favorite magazine cover, with JF preparing a fairly unconcerned JL as a human sacrifice. There were a lot of locks scattered about and JF was holding up an incredibly ornate heart-shaped key. (Drawing: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/394330224265003010/488026330492043295/IMG_20180908_124204.jpg)

There was a gallery of other, more recent covers, in all of which Flans always seemed to have his face far too close and off to the side, exactly like Kirk in Star Trek:TAS.

I dreamt the 90s Johns had a bit that they did during live performances of Hot Cha (I think?) where stagehands tied them to large panes of transparent plastic and carried them around the stage as they sang.

I dreamt that I was going to get to see Lemon Demon live in an outdoor venue. I'd just walked out of a garden after having a nice conversation with Neil Cicierega, and while I was waiting by the stage I saw that I was standing near 80s Bill Krauss and John Flansburgh. 

Krauss kept pointing to a woman in the front row who'd apparently done a cover of one of Flans' songs and kept saying it was "just like getting laid!"
'Don't say that,' JF begged, obviously baffled by the wording. 'I have no idea what you're trying to say.' Bill refused to clarify beyond repeating the phrase louder and louder until Flans looked mortified.

I never got to see the Lemon Demon live show-- I woke up.

A long, complicated dream concluded with hiding in a cave from something frightening that was after me. Another man was in the cave, vehemently attempting to convince me that John was both of Their last names,  actually, and they were married to each other so it made sense. He argued that they had met each other and realized they had the same name, which legally meant they HAD to get married. I could not get him to shut up about this, which was compromising my hiding spot. I hope he got eaten by whatever it was that was chasing me.

I dreamt that I was at the Portland TMBG concert I had tickets to. They didn't play a single song I recognized from their actual discography, but it was enjoyable.

There was one song where audience participation was encouraged, and I found myself holding an accordion (I could not play accordion at the time) and I tried to play along with limited success. But then, as they were announcing the next song, I accidentally made a REALLY loud sound with it and they both looked at me and John L said "Don't do that." in an stern tone. When I apologized JF couldn't hear me and asked me to repeat myself, and I ended up having to apologize AGAIN and it was terribly awkward.

During my dream, I found a Lemon Demon poster taped to the wall. As I was admiring it, John Linnell came up behind me and sadly commented, "It's too bad. I can't look at the Lemon Demon logo without feeling a little dizzy, because back when I played with them I'd drank too much soda and I was mildly hallucinating." Then the dream moved on.
