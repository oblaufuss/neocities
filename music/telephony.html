  <button class="accordion">What sort of music do you play?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Official answer: a genre of music I like to call "telephony" or "imaginary rock".</p>
    <p>More truthful answer: Whatever I like to listen to and think my friends would like too.</p>
    <p>Most helpful answer: see the "Past Shows" tab below.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">What is "Telephony?"</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>A genre label I just sort of made up. It's meant to represent the nebulous grouping of alt-alt-rock popularized among certain young people on the internet: melody focused like the Beatles, courting an 80s new-wave aesthetic, popular for lyrics that are morbid but playful and a willingness to experiment with their sound. My 3 favorite bands at the core of this sound are <strong>They Might Be Giants</strong>, <strong>Lemon Demon</strong>, and <strong>Tally Hall</strong>; but <strong>Jack Stauber</strong>, <strong>Sparks</strong>, <strong>Bill Wurtz</strong>, and <strong>Oingo Boingo</strong> are also good examples.</p>
    <p>One of the things that makes the genre hard to describe is that the shared fanbase defines it as much as the music does. It's a nebulous label, as it should be. If you're wondering how close your favorite band is to my personal idea of the genre, though, you can try <a href="https://www.quotev.com/quiz/13066472/Is-it-Telephony">this little diagnostic quiz</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">How was the name chosen?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>For a couple of years now, I've observed how established this intersecting fanbase is and wished I had a way to describe it. After deciding to start this show, I brainstormed with some friends and we came up with some name options which I put in <a href="https://twitter.com/mojochessmaster/status/1304204920116002817">a Twitter poll</a>. "Telephony" won by a landslide, with "imaginary rock" in second.</p>
     <p>"Telephony" is actually a word having to do with telecommunications technology. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephony">Wikipedia</a>: <em>"the field of technology involving telecommunication services for electronic transmission of voice, fax, or data between distant parties."</em></p>
     <p>The word suggests an internet fanbase or online radio show like this one. It's nonsense-sounding, like "fabloo", and doesn't describe the genre enough to pin it down. It feels silly and fun to say but means something important. I don't know, it's just a word. But it's a nice one.</p>
