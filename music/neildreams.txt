I dreamt that my younger sister was making a music video for a "new" LD song (judging by Neil's age when I saw him, it was actually 2008) about how getting possessed could be the solution to all your problems. The video was an infomercial about cereal. There was a live listening party where they sold t-shirts and John Linnell was there, along with some other celebrities. I got Neil to sign something but he wrote every letter in a different place on it, rendering his signature illegible.

I dreamt I was back at Ladiescon in Somerville, where I met Ming Doyle. I was back in the basement with AJ, at the piano (all of which was true to real life). AJ sat down and said "watch this" and played Cabinet Man in its entirety, complete with all the synth sounds and everything, album-perfect.

I dreamt my friend Riley was MC'ing a talent show related to Neil content. There were covers of songs, poems, etc. I woke up right as about 30 kids, many of which were wearing matching t-shirts as one does at a summer camp, streamed onto stage to do some sort of largely improvised dance and singalong to Crocodile Chop.

I dreamt that as I was driving, the radio announced that the city of Somerville was having its name changed. I immediately became horribly lost because of this. "I hope Neil doesn't get lost on his way home, too," I thought.

I dreamt that Neil was going to play some Lemon Demon live at an event in an outdoor garden. I got to talk to him, and he claimed that it didn't count as an event because it was all old songs. I asked him about something he'd posted on his tumblr. I don't remember my question exactly or his answer, but it was a pleasant conversation. I woke up before the performance.

I dreamt I was reading a newspaper, and in it was an obituary for Ryan T. Murphy. I became so confused that I woke up and it took me several minutes to remember if he was actually dead or not.

After a very long and restless night of dreams, I was putting down a sleeping bag when 20-year-old original NKOTR Kevin came by with his own sleeping bag and asked if I minded if he put his down nearby. I said it was fine. We both lay down and I mentioned "hey, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days,"(this was shortly before the G*V screening) and he replied "I know."
Pretty much the moment I put my head on the pillow, my alarm went off and I real-life woke up.

I dreamt I was camping in a bed in the woods and something was scuttling around in the darkness, so I set a trap (it was a very Acme cartoon snare, just a noose that I set on the ground, pretending to be asleep while holding one end of the rope). I caught a 2008-era Neil by the big toe.

I dreamt that I was watching Neil, Kevin, and Ryan giving a presentation about a frog rehabilitation project they were working on. They were 3D printing out body parts for frogs that were missing them. Neil told us "this frog was missing its head so I thought it would be funny if I gave it a cow head" held up a frog with a tiny purple plastic cow head, but with actual little frog eyes looking out the eyeholes.
I felt vague fear.

Neil, Kevin, and Ryan were all shipwrecked and stranded on a raft. Ryan, but only Ryan, was dressed as a pirate.  They were afraid that they were going to run out of food and starve, so Ryan convinced Neil that they should eat Kevin (Neil was ALARMINGLY easy to convince). It ended with Neil and Ryan chasing Kevin with kitchen utensils around and around the edge of the raft, Looney Tunes style.
